// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

// Correct order of steps
// 1. Planning
// 2. Analysis of Requirements
// 3. Design
// 4. Implementation
// 5. Testing & integration
// 6. Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which we review the plan and determine what the applications purpose is. What is this going to do?"
const design = "This is the third step, this is where to will model te way the software or the application will work, the structure, what platforms we are going to use?"
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, this is where we will actually write the program and get it ready to test"
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the 5th step, in which we will test the program making sure all functions are working"
const maintain = "This is the last step, in which the program in done and is being used. in this step we continue to resolve bugs and fix errors that were not found during the testing phase"
